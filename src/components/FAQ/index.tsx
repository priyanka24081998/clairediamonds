      {
        question: "Are lab-grown diamonds real?",
        answer:
          "Yes! Lab grown diamonds, also known as laboratory grown diamonds or ethical lab grown diamonds, are chemically identical to mined diamonds or natural diamonds. They offer the same level of beauty and are an extremely popular choice.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "What is the difference between a simulant and a lab grown diamond?",
        answer:
          "A lab grown diamond, unlike a simulant, has the same chemical and physical properties as a mined diamond. They are aesthetically identical to naturally mined diamonds, offering the same fire and brilliance.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "What is the difference between a mined diamond and a lab grown diamond?",
        answer:
          "The only difference between a mined diamond and a lab grown diamond is their origin. Lab grown diamonds are an ethical and sustainable option, offering the same fire, clarity, and carat weights as mined diamonds.",
      },
      {
        question: "Are lab grown diamonds ethical?",
        answer:
          "Lab grown diamonds are a sustainable option, created using advanced technology under high pressure, which is much more ethical than traditional diamond mining methods.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "How does Claire Diamonds ensure a seamless purchase experience?",
        answer:

    ],
    moissanite: [
      {
        question: "Is moissanite worth buying?",
        answer:
          "Moissanite is a brilliant choice for those seeking an alternative to a lab diamond engagement ring. It offers the same level of clarity and is graded by Australia-based Radiant Beauty to ensure top quality, just like our lab grown diamond collections.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can moissanite pass diamond tester?",
        answer: "Yes. Due to its similar properties to diamonds (both lab grown and mined or natural diamond rings), moissanite can pass a diamond tester. However, our specialised equipment can distinguish between moissanite and diamonds, ensuring you know exactly what you're purchasing.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is moissanite the best fake diamond?",
        answer: "Moissanite is not a fake diamond but a gemstone that offers stunning lab grown beauty. It's perfect for those looking for the same level of sparkle and clarity found in diamonds, but at a more accessible price point.",
      },
      {
        question: "Are moissanite rings tacky?",
        answer: "Absolutely not! Due to its diamond-like appearance, many people believe the misconception that moissanite is a fake diamond when it is in fact a high quality, beautiful gemstone in its own right. Moissanite is becoming an increasingly popular choice of stone in engagement rings due to its dazzling beauty, durability, ease of customisation and affordability.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do moissanite rings look fake?",
        answer: "No, moissanite rings are crafted to exhibit a sparkle that, to the naked eye, is akin to that of diamonds. They offer timeless beauty and are an aesthetically identical choice for those who admire the appearance of mined diamonds.",
      },
      {
        question: "Does moissanite lose its sparkle?",
        answer: "Moissanite retains its sparkle indefinitely, much like our lab grown and rings. Its clarity and carat weight remain intact, ensuring a lifetime of brilliance.",
      },
      {
        question: "How can I find the perfect moissanite engagement ring at Claire Diamonds?",
        answer: "We make it easy to find your ideal moissanite engagement ring.
